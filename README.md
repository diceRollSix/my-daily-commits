# My daily commits

### Commits for a day on one page.  
App can gather commits for day/current week/previous week.  
I use it for stand-up meeting.  
App helps me stop writing meaningless commit messages.  
Hard to read list of commits like "fix" or "update" :smiley: 

## Token
You need to [generate](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) personal access token for app.  
Choose __repo:status__ if you need to get commits only from you private repositories.  
Or choose __repo__ if you wand to see commits that you contributed in other repositories.

Token and other settings will be save in local storage.
